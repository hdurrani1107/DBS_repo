    "Analysis:\n",
    "Both flake8 and pylint were more focused on the formatting of the code pointing out bad identation, white space issues, and whether words were too long. They also pointed out unused variables and unncessary function usage which was very interesting. The main difference between the two is that pylint provides a score at the end indicating the quality of the code based on formatting standards. This is a useful part, that pylint has over all three. Ruff was interesting as is seemed to be focused on issues that might hinder code and efficiency such as unusued variables and unnecessary colons and semicolons. "

    "After making significant changes our code score in pylint went up from 1.08/10 to 10/10 which is very significant and provides an actual metric of code improvement. For Ruff, there is a nice all checks passed marking that lets the user know there is nothing to improve. For flake8 there still is items to improve. After spending sometime, these results don't particularly make sense as to why. Each line pointed out in flake8 is a function like that doesn't have trailing whitespace or is too long. So there may be some bugginess to flake8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code looks to be improved, the documentation and readability of the code is much better. Some of the changes, a miniscule (such as trailing whitespace) and are hard to see while others are very noticeable (such as added docstrings). I think that pylint and flake8 provide the most comprehensive formatting help with pylint taking a the slight edge due to the score and potential bugginess mentioned earlier. Ruff is very useful, because it is well integrated with vscode and ruff can actually pick up errors in real time and offer changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these tools seem to improve the code in terms of readability, efficiency, and formatting. In terms of comprehensive linting and formatting the list is pylint, flake8, and ruff. In terms of integration with vscode, the list if ruff, pylint, and flake8. All of them can be used very easily, however, both ruff and pylint indicate errors in the actual codebase, where as, flake8 needs to be run separately on the file. The only caveat to everything it that your code can still have errors and not work, but be formatted and linted very well. So these tools are used, as mentioned above, for readability, efficiency and formatting but not to solve and fix bugs in the code."
