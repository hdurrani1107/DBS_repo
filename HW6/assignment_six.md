Groups of up to size 3 are permitted.

Assignment value: one of 10 required weekly assignments.



Background
----------
There are two basic kinds of tools that can be used to improve
and evaluate the readability of code.

- formatter: source style enforcers / formatters
- linter: a static code analyzer is a tool that analyzes source code for errors, bugs, and other issues.


Here is a (partial) list of the most important tools available:


- ruff
- flake8
- autopep8
- pycodestyle 
- black
- pylint
- isort 
- mccabe 
- mypy
- coverage

We will cover generative AI based approaches such as cursor.ai in a later assignment.


For fun:

- import this
- google "tabs vs spaces silicon valley"

For background

- PEP 8: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
