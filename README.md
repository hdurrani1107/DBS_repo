Projects in order:
1. HW1
  - Rudimentary searcher function that searches files in a directory executed through the command prompt. Can search files based on filename, type, text-to-search and date within a specified directory.
2. HW2
  - Utilizing pandas dataframes, we are importing two json files one with students, their ID's, and GPA, and another json file that imports assessment criteria and grading breakdown. From there, we utilize panda to generate a dataframe that contains the entire gradebook, combining the first json file with the created grades from each assessment and their final grade.
3. HW3
  - Utilizing pandas dataframes, we explored numbers and different ways to utilize pandas.
4. HW4
  - Creates interactive science lessons using jupyter notebook and ipywidgets. Each each lesson talks about a different mechanical element: gear ratios, cam follower, and 4-bar linkages.
5. HW5
  - Created a grading rubric for homework 5 on designing a lattice visualization tool using classes for python.
  - Created the lattice visualization tool in jupyter notebook.
6. HW6
  - Experimented with linting and formatting tools to perfect code formatting.
  - Tested the tools on a list of python files, from a previous class of students, that create different combinations of seating arrangements at a wedding.
  - Out of a list picked a file, linted and formatted it, and cleaned up the code to develop proficiency and understanding of the tools and what good code looks like.
7. HW7
  - Created an autograder for the wedding python files and graded the set of homework based on personally set criteria. Autogrades all the homeworks compared to an answer key and produces a grade.
8. Chess Engine
  - Created a minimax alpha-beta pruning chess engine that can be played in the command terminal using chess python library. Uses standard book openings and calculates optimal moves. Also has a configuration to play against other chess engines. Check out the chess engine github repository on hdurrani1107's account for future updates to this project.
