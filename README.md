Projects in order:
1. Searcher.py
  - Rudimentary searcher function that searches files in a directory executed through the command prompt. Can search files based on filename, type, text-to-search and date within a specified directory.
2. Gradebook.py
  - Utilizing pandas dataframes, we are importing two json files one with students, their ID's, and GPA, and another json file that imports assessment criteria and grading breakdown. From there, we utilize panda to generate a dataframe that contains the entire gradebook, combining the first json file with the created grades from each assessment and their final grade.
