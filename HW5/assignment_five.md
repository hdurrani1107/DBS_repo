Assignment Description
----------------------

Title: EC602 Homework Math Model

Your task for this EC602 homework is to write an EC602 homework. [Look up "meta" and "recursion"]

The deliverables for this assignment are:

- an assignment description written in LaTeX, Markdown, or Jupyter Notebook format.
- an example solution that meets the requirements as specified in the assignment description.

Your assignment must be based on developing a model using Python's `class` mechanism, possibly also using inheritance.

Your assignment should 

- describe the mathematical object being modeled, along with appropriate reference and/or background material.
- describe the administrative details for the assignment: due dates, deliverables, point values, submission mechanism
- describe the problem requirements, including: user interface, operations to be supported, error handling. These should be specific enough that the solutions provided by the students are testable and gradable using an autograding system.
- specify what Python libraries are expected to be used and what Python libraries are not allowed.
- provide a grading scheme
- if appropriate, provide examples of "how to use" the submitted software


Your group may choose the mathematical entity you will be asking your students to develop a model of. 
Some examples are

- polynomials
- finite fields 
- complex numbers
- quaternions
- rings
- polygons
- graphs (edges and vertices)

In addition to writing the description of the assignment, you should also develop a solution. 
These two tasks (writing the assignment, and developing the soluton) are often best done in parallel.
